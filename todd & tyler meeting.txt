How will google searches get to the site - do we need some SEO consideration?
Email results should have a checkbox to also send to CCIJ
Assess tool should be the first option
Should there be some level of follow-up within / around the tool? E.g. if someone emails themselves results perhaps it should also email an address at CCIJ so that someone could follow up?
Using the tool could be emtionally raw for a user and this might need to be managed. Reactions might be different to the people that Matt deals with as they have already decided they are comfortable talking about it
"Why this question" perhaps should avoid explaining the reason for the question and focus on helping people understand how the question should be answered
Put questions through reading level test - should be grade 6 or 7
How much time should be set aside and should they have someone with them?
It's OK to not answer questions, though this will impact how helpful the tool can be
Set expectations up front - base case and worse case
trigger warning and suggestions for psychological support - users will likely have legal and psychological concerns both
0 options should immediately move to show text on available options
soften colours and make question text bigger - more engaging
tool takes the place of a real person who would be giving non-verbal cues on their level of engagement
space for a tagline under the title: e.g. "communications for a modern world" (rhyming / alliteration helpful) helps people remember. "informing survivors about their options" / "guiding"? suggests more involvement, but maybe too much
check out typeform for guidance on user experience
perhaps give feedback about % complete as working through
