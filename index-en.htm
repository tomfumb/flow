					<div id="flow_question_1">
						<div class="question-content">In what country did the abuse(s) occur?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Most tribunals and justice processes only have authority over abuses that occur in some countries but not others. For example, the United Nations Committee Against Torture can only examine possible cases of torture when the country responsible has agreed that the Committee can examine cases involving that country.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_2a">
						<div class="question-content">Did people who are citizens of any other country participate in the abuse(s)?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Some tribunals and justice processes only have authority over abuses committed by people who are citizens of certain countries. For example, citizens of countries that agreed to the treaty of the International Criminal Court can be prosecuted by the Court, even if the crimes occurred in a different country.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_2b">
						<div class="question-content">What citizenship did they have?</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_3">
						<div class="question-content">What is the date on which the abuse(s) happened? (If the abuses included detention or torture, when did the detention or torture end?)</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">The authority of some tribunals or justice processes is restricted to abuses committed before or after certain dates. Often, this is the date when a country agreed to a particular treaty.  For example, the International Criminal Court can only investigate abuses that occurred after July 1, 2002, when the Court's treaty came into force. Also, some tribunals and justice processes require survivors or families to file their cases within a certain amount of time after the abuses occurred. This is known as "prescription" or a "limitations period."</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_4">
						<div class="question-content">At the time of the abuse(s), what country was the victim a citizen of?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">This question is often important in criminal proceedings, and some national courts have authority to hear cases involving crimes committed against their citizens abroad. For example, the government of Canada has the power to criminally prosecute people who commit certain crimes against Canadian citizens even if they occur outside Canada.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_5a">
						<div class="question-content">At the time of the abuse(s), was the victim a citizen of any other country?</div>

						<div class="question-content">Of which other country was the victim a citizen at the time of the abuse(s)?</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_6">
						<div class="question-content">Describe the abuse(s) committed against the victim.</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Different tribunals and justice processes have authority over different kinds of human rights abuses. Some, like the United Nations Human Rights Committee, can consider a wide range of abuses. Others, like the Committee Against Torture, can consider a smaller set of abuses. Selecting the relevant acts on this list will provide the information necessary to determine which abuses might have been committed and therefore which tribunals and justice processes might be available.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_7">
						<div class="question-content">Did the abuse(s) take place during a war?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Some tribunals have authority over crimes that occur as a part of an international or civil war. These are known as "war crimes." Other tribunals have authority over crimes that did not happen during a war. For example, the International Criminal Court may be able to prosecute the murder of a civilian as a "war crime" if soldiers committed that murder during a war.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_8">
						<div class="question-content">Were these kinds of abuses committed against many other people in the country at that time?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Some tribunals have authority over crimes that are widespread or systematic in nature. These are known as "crimes against humanity." For example, the International Criminal Court can prosecute murder as a "crime against humanity" if that murder was part of widespread violence against civilians.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_9">
						<div class="question-content">Was the victim targeted because of her/his race, ethnicity, religion or nationality?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Some tribunals have authority over the crime of genocide, which refers to certain acts that are committed with the intention to destroy a particular group. For example, the International Criminal Court may be able to prosecute the killing or forced displacement of people of a particular religion or race.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_10">
						<div class="question-content">Who committed the abuse(s)?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">The authority of some tribunals and justice processes is limited to acts committed by government officials and does not extend to crimes committed by civilians. For example, "torture" is a human rights abuse that usually requires government involvement. If someone is beaten but there is no government involvement then it usually is not considered "torture" and falls outside the authority of international justice processes.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_11">
						<div class="question-content">Are any of the people responsible for the abuse(s) currently living in Canada?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Certain legal processes in Canada are possible when the person responsible for abuses is living in Canada. For example, the Canadian government may be able to criminally prosecute, deport or revoke the citizenship of someone living in Canada who might have been involved in human rights abuses.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_12">
						<div class="question-content">Do any of the people responsible for the abuse(s) ever visit Canada?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Canada has the authority to pursue justice against people who committed certain abuses in other countries. When such a person visits Canada or tries to visit Canada, it may be possible for the Canadian government to take action, most likely through immigration penalties like deportation or denial of a visa.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_13">
						<div class="question-content">Do any of the people responsible for the abuse(s) ever travel outside the country where the abuse(s) happened?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Many countries around the world have the authority to prosecute people present in their territory who committed certain abuses, no matter where the abuses happened. Although analysis of this option is too complicated for this website, the answer to this question could be useful to CCIJ if you decide to contact us about your justice options.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_14a">
						<div class="question-content">In your opinion, in the country where the abuse(s) occurred, are the courts fair and independent, such that justice can be achieved there?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Many tribunals and justice processes assume that governments have the primary responsibility to investigate and punish abuses in the place where they happened. For this reason, their authority may be limited to situations in which the responsible government is unwilling or unable to take action or the courts are not fair and independent.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_14b">
						<div class="question-content">Did the victim or the victim's family try to bring a case or a complaint before the courts, the police or other authorities in the country where the abuses occurred?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">If the survivor or victim's family has tried to bring a case in the country where the abuses occurred but that case failed for certain reasons, this might make it more likely that an international justice process might look into the case.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_14c">
						<div class="question-content">What was the result?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">If the survivor or victim's family has tried to bring a case in the country where the abuses occurred but that case failed for certain reasons, this might make it more likely that an international justice process might look into the case.</div>
					</div>
					<div id="flow_question_15">
						<div class="question-content">Has the victim or the victim's family submitted a complaint to any other international court or body?</div>
						<div class="question-explanation">Some tribunals and justice processes want to avoid duplicating the work of other justice processes. As a result, many will decline to accept a case if another tribunal or justice process is already reviewing the case.</div>
