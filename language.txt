foreign language version

- new index.htm
- new templates
- question values remain the same
- outcome condition functions remain the same
- question text needs to be conditional - if only a single text value is provided for the answer then that is both the display and the value. If two values are provided ['one', 'two'] then the first is the value and the second is the display text
