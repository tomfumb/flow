	<p>Please note that <strong>this site provides only information, not legal advice</strong>. A legal case cannot be based on the results of this questionnaire, as every case and every legal process is unique and complex. This website is designed to help you understand what options might be available and is not designed to make a final conclusion about your case.</p>
	<p>After completing the questionnaire, if you are interested in pursuing justice, we encourage you to <a href="http://ccij.ca/about/contact/index.php" target="_blank">contact CCIJ</a>. If your case requires legal advice or you wish to speak to a lawyer, CCIJ may be able to help connect you to a lawyer.</p>
	<p>At the end of the questionnaire you will be given the opportunity to email the results of this questionnaire to CCIJ or to email it to yourself or print it for your own records. This information is not being stored and CCIJ will only have a record of it if you email your results to CCIJ. CCIJ will keep your email address and results confidential. Emailing your results to CCIJ does not mean that you have started a legal case.</p>
	<p>If you are on a public computer, please remember to close the program, window, or tab after you are finished with this website.</p>
	<p>This website does not assess all acts that might be considered human rights abuses and is limited to acts that are considered by international law to be the most severe violations. Generally, this website only assesses acts that might constitute torture, war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, extrajudicial killing and forced disappearance. This website is not designed to address other abuses, for example free speech issues, labour rights or environmental issues.</p>
	<p>When answering the questions, please make your best guess about the answer. Some questions allow you to answer "unknown" if you do not know the answer.</p>
