- Swipe fails on Android for questions, question summary buttons, and outcome previews. Due to Android / JQuery-Mobile bug (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=19827)
- Double-answering of single click questions (e.g. Yes, No, Unknown) with a double-click is prevented up to a point but not entirely. Double-answering leads to double-transitions on all but the last questions. Additional/double answers are prevented during the 300ms delay before the question is set as answered - which then triggers the slide advance on all but the last question. However this prevention is removed immediately before the slide starts and it's still possible to double-answer as the transition is getting going. This could potentially be addressed through a onAfterHide function, which is when answers would be permitted again, within QuestionView which is called by ContentView immediately before / after QuestionView's onBeforeShow. However it would need consideration for the last question which triggers the "what's next" screen instead of the next question. Also it would need to be clear what happens if a double transition happens (which is valid) where a question is only briefly shown.
