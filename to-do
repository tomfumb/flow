- for multi-select questions with checkboxes - update answersSelected every time a box is checked and 'Continue' button is just another forward navigation button. 'Continue' should only be available if there is a following question. Requires a change to MainView.onAnswersSelected to make sure we don't move to the next question if this is just a checkbox update
- when a question or outcome's visibility / availability is dependent on certain answer/s being selected the inspect function should also verify that those answers are available and log an error if not
- can it handle swipe actions? Back / fwd should permit this

- Need carousel content height to be something other than fixed pixel height
- Use history api to make browser's back button work like previous question button

- if possible to move fwd and back through questions regardless of what's answered the UI should show which questions have been passed unanswered
- checkbox answers text should check textbox
