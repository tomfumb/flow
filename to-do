To Do
- do we keep the Stories project link or is it delegated to the CCIJ site - question for Pam
	- mention the possibility of having real or hypothetical cases alongside the tool for people to work through for education
- collect all countries with dates in array, separate fn for verify each country only once
- add new mechanism charts
- create lorem ipsum language version to ensure that the language approach is valid and how much effort is involved
- only have useful log messages
- implement error logging to server, have log emailed and deleted if it exceeds a given size
- icon for question area (ESL)
- SEO (French?)
- sliding 'available' screen - do tabs still fit on mobile screen?
- soften colours and make question text bigger - more engaging
- social media sharing icons
- perhaps give feedback about % complete as working through
- Mobile issues:
1) modals still too big for small screen
2) swiping has broken - jquery-mobile not referenced as a dependency
3) date picker isn't obvious when presented with keyboard input beneath text input
4) question summary list should just be one row, swipeable / pageable like outcomes list. Will require some complex logic to ensure the current question is as close to the centre of that display as possible
- test case - slow download of resources, anything available before it will actually work?
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers
- tip buttons near key functionality explaining what's going on
- use gallery-style slider for outcome previews and question summaries, must ensure current question always visible
- main CCIJ site has Google Analytics - should incorporate the async version of this too, log trips to all #destinations
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
- Pam's style guide

Considerations (for Chris):
- Using the tool could be emtionally raw for a user and this might need to be managed. Reactions might be different to the people that Matt deals with as they have already decided they are comfortable talking about it
- Reading level of tool & question text, would be best at grade 6 or 7
- how much time should be set aside and should they have someone with them?
- it's OK to not answer questions, though this will impact how helpful the tool can be
- Set expectations up front - base case and worse case
- trigger warning and suggestions for psychological support - users may have both legal and psychological concerns
