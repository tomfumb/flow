To Do
- see if the carousel can be stopped mid-transition for a new transition as this will happen to the question summary row
- fix height of question summaries AND *ensure* that ('#flow_question_summary_container'), which is swipeable, is directly over the question summaries, otherwise swiping will be really weird
- ensure carousel speed and summary transition speed are in-sync, then standardise slide speed values using global
- do we keep the Stories project link or is it delegated to the CCIJ site - question for Pam
	- mention the possibility of having real or hypothetical cases alongside the tool for people to work through for education
- add new mechanism charts
- add updated text
- revert to 12 in bootstrap
- figure out a way to have question answers use single english values but foreign language text
	- create lorem ipsum language version to ensure that the language approach is valid and how much effort is involved
- only have useful log messages
- SEO (French?)
- sliding 'available' screen - do tabs still fit on mobile screen?
- soften colours and make question text bigger - more engaging
- social media sharing icons
- add small text for Question 1 (of 19) or similar
- Mobile issues:
1) modals still too big for small screen
2) swiping has broken - jquery-mobile not referenced as a dependency
3) date picker isn't obvious when presented with keyboard input beneath text input
4) question summary list should just be one row, swipeable / pageable like outcomes list. Will require some complex logic to ensure the current question is as close to the centre of that display as possible
- test case - slow download of resources, anything available before it will actually work?
- test case - remove all outcome previews, what happens to slide / visible logic?
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers
- tip buttons near key functionality explaining what's going on
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
- remove logos - will be provided by Wise & Hammer

Wise & Hammer meeting
- possibly ask user for name / location and have opt-in for newsletter at end of tool
	- change what's next screen to ask for email address and opt-in to newsletter

Considerations (for Chris):
- Using the tool could be emtionally raw for a user and this might need to be managed. Reactions might be different to the people that Matt deals with as they have already decided they are comfortable talking about it
- Reading level of tool & question text, would be best at grade 6 or 7
- how much time should be set aside and should they have someone with them?
- it's OK to not answer questions, though this will impact how helpful the tool can be
- Set expectations up front - base case and worse case
- trigger warning and suggestions for psychological support - users may have both legal and psychological concerns
