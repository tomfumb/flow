- update outcome rules 
- am I updating list (and number) of available outcomes each time one changes its availability? that could potentially change multiple times each answer is changed, is there a more efficient way to do this that also solves the issue below of showing when all outcome updates have completed?
- need some way of notifying which outcomes' availability changed due to the last answered question (use abbreviations as links) - part of an approach in onOutcomesUpdated in outcome preview view but this function is called each time a single outcome is updated, not when all updates have finished, need a way of knowing this so that all changes can be described at once. Test with an 'outcomeUpdatesFinished' event.
- update rules on mechanisms that have them
- Mobile issues:
1) phone browser doesn't work for clicking on .entry-point text / image
2) modal doesn't scroll when off screen
3) date picker isn't obvious when presented with keyboard input beneath text input
- when resizing container to fit summary height is not always correctly set - sometimes under or over shot. Possibly related to the briefly-displayed vertical scroll bar? Look for a pattern in this happening when the container gets larger or shorter relative to the previous slide
- some scenario where question summary links can be repeated and clicking the duplicates messes things up
- consider not automatically advancing the carousel if the user has explicitly requested a specific question, or if the following question is already answered - could get messy / confusing
- if the last question is conditionally available, is answered, and then becomes unavailable it is still treated as an available question (summary highlights as active and quesion is shown).
- Multiple consecutive conditional questions - if c is dependent on b and b dependent on a c should be unavailable when b is unavailable
- test case - what happens if a second answer is given during slide transition, does it slide twice?
- handle swipe actions for question back / fwd
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers
- tip buttons near key functionality explaining what's going on
- email results to user
- text wrap problem in single_few answers with long text when page narrow
- use gallery-style slider for outcome previews
- try to get rid of table in outcome previews
- notify user of which outcomes have changed their availability
- ensure user sees a notification about number change if it's off-screen when it changes
- main CCIJ site has Google Analytics - should incorporate the async version of this too, log trips to all #destinations
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
- consider creating sprite for images, especially logos with fixed size
- minify / compress js
