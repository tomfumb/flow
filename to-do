To Do

HIGH
- remaining mechanisms (Canada criminal court still ongoing)
- possibly ask user for name / location and have opt-in for newsletter at end of tool
	- change what's next screen to ask for email address and opt-in to newsletter
- does email address get retained across screens?
- text updates
- Mobile issues:
1) modals still too big for small screen (scrollable?)
2) swiping has broken - jquery-mobile not referenced as a dependency
3) date picker isn't obvious when presented with keyboard input beneath text input

MEDIUM
- problem with english and french requirejs builds - can it use targets?
- revert to 12 in bootstrap
- see if the carousel can be stopped mid-transition for a new transition as this will happen to the question summary row
- Any need to modify or add to statement about public computer
- style outcome navigate buttons
- Text flash for options updated
- remove logos - will be provided by Wise & Hammer
- order french country names
- ensure carousel speed and summary transition speed are in-sync, then standardise slide speed values using global

LOW
- only have useful log messages
- soften colours and make question text bigger - more engaging
- should have more consistency in index.htm IDs
- SEO (French?)
- test case - slow download of resources, anything available before it will actually work?
- test case - remove all outcome previews, what happens to slide / visible logic?
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers

VERY LOW
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
