To Do

QUESTIONS
- which version of IE does Matt have?
- what is/are correct date/s for Bosnia?

HIGH
- add Stories links back in
- remaining mechanisms (*** Civil Canada in testing ***)
- cross-browser testing (IE, Firefox)
- swipe fails on Android Chrome
- why does selecting date make mechanisms unavailable?
- check license and ownership
- Completion email
	- testing, what to look for (one person per mechanism ?)
	- availability & committment, build a to-do list for me
	- french version
- Handover email
	- mailchimp integration
	- github
	- languages
	- my availability
	- contact info
	- explanation of mechanism conditions
	- server move considerations
	- restrictions?
	- deployment process (grunt tasks, testing, devices)

MEDIUM
- justify home page text
- additional space between mechanism description and caveat(s)
- figure out how to deploy with debug level change - necessary?
- double-clicking an answer triggers two question answered events - should disable question answering during answer/advance delay
- v-mouse integration?
- undo auto-focus on email address in next steps
- revert to 12 in bootstrap
- see if the carousel can be stopped mid-transition for a new transition as this will happen to the question summary row
- style outcome navigate buttons
- seem to be several conditions where phone needs scrolling to top of page
- ensure carousel speed and summary transition speed are in-sync, then standardise slide speed values using global
- update spreadsheet for any mechanism that had Disappearance added

LOW
- log info message on why a mechanism is eliminated
- only have useful log messages
- soften colours and make question text bigger - more engaging
- should have more consistency in index.htm IDs
- SEO (French?)
- test case - slow download of resources, anything available before it will actually work?
- test case - remove all outcome previews, what happens to slide / visible logic?
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers

VERY LOW
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
