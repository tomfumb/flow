- PrintView needs to handle answerChanged same as MainView
- Questions should show which answer was selected
- If answering question with select list should transition after a slight delay during which the select list and navigation buttons are disabled
- Answers must be able to link to multiple outcomes
- carousel events for slide and slid need to control the availability of navigation buttons
- Need carousel content height to be something other than fixed pixel height
- Should be showing available outcomes already too
- Use history api to make browser's back button work like previous question button
