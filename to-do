- calendar implementation needs finishing, must answer following questions (next line)
- how does calendar interact with 'has answer' functionality? new validation function required. Will the answer be selectable if it's not an option?
- observed one case where answeredQuestion in OutcomeManagerView became detached from collection? answeredQuestion.collection was undefined. need to understand how this is possible
- some scenario where question summary links can be repeated and clicking the duplicates messes things up
- what happens if last question is conditional and the last available question makes it available - do the navigation buttons recognise this or act as if there are no more questions?
- set up routing with history API - handle page loading with hash location and question / area navigation history
- can it handle swipe actions? Back / fwd should permit this
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers
- tip buttons near key functionality explaining what's going on
- some sort of guide-through for new users (cookies?)
- separate remedies into available and unavailable
- consider stacking or hiding stacked for remedies
- 320px for phone
- replace many instances of col- classes with single approach where possible
- style drop-down menus
- vertical overflow bar briefly showing in some carousel transitions
