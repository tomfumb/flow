- what happens if last question is conditional and the last available question makes it available - do the navigation buttons recognise this or act as if there are no more questions?
- set up routing with history API - handle page loading with hash location and question / area navigation history
- for multi-select questions with checkboxes - update answersSelected every time a box is checked and 'Continue' button is just another forward navigation button. 'Continue' should only be available if there is a following question. Requires a change to MainView.onAnswersSelected to make sure we don't move to the next question if this is just a checkbox update.
- related to above - perhaps last question should have a 'finished' button, regardless of answer display type. Then the final set of modals can always be raised.
- when a question or outcome's visibility / availability is dependent on certain answer/s being selected the inspect function should also verify that those answers are available and log an error if not
- can it handle swipe actions? Back / fwd should permit this
