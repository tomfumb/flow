BUGS
- need to look at what's wrong with fwd / back logic. UI can follow impossible flows. Takes a few forward and back moves to reproduce. Probably easier to look at the code than try to trace the log.
	- might be easier to figure out if selected answer is marked
	- Availability of fwd / back buttons may not be tied to answerChanged event and clearing future views
- ** should refactor removal of future answers to something like this:
	- separate fn to get index of any question / view / carousel item
	- can carousel handle availability of left/right buttons on its own??? (should do)
		- can it handle swipe actions? Back / fwd should permit this
	- separate function clearFutureQuestions manages both the array and carousel DOM elements
	- items in questions array have reference to their container DOM element
- outcomes do not seem to be correctly identified as available / unavailable. After answering 1st question all were flagged as available

- determine if OutcomePreviewView models keep up with available attribute and if so use in event handler
- PrintView needs to handle answerChanged same as MainView
- Questions should show which answer was selected
- http://blog.jetstrap.com/2013/08/bootstrap-3-grids-explained/ - buttons will screw up at col-1, needs fixing for small screens
- If answering question with select list should transition after a slight delay during which the select list and navigation buttons are disabled
- what happens with large numbers of outcomes?
- Answers must be able to link to multiple outcomes
- carousel events for slide and slid need to control the availability of navigation buttons
- Need carousel content height to be something other than fixed pixel height
- Carousel navigation buttons should be in left / right floating DIVs and added by the ContentView - can't be controlled by QuestionView as this immediately slides out of view
- Use history api to make browser's back button work like previous question button
