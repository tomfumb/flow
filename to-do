progressing on adjusting outcome row's left when adding / removing previews but issues determining which is the first visible preview. apparently cannot rely on preview width and left position of move container being correct. Currently not handling the case where the first visible is the one that disappears. complicated
add swipe support to outcome preview row

To Do
- figure out a way to have question answers use single english values but foreign language text
- update deployment process - shouldn't do minification as that should already be done and tested
- do we keep the Stories project link or is it delegated to the CCIJ site - question for Pam
	- mention the possibility of having real or hypothetical cases alongside the tool for people to work through for education
- add new mechanism charts
- create lorem ipsum language version to ensure that the language approach is valid and how much effort is involved
- only have useful log messages
- icon for question area (ESL)
- SEO (French?)
- sliding 'available' screen - do tabs still fit on mobile screen?
- soften colours and make question text bigger - more engaging
- social media sharing icons
- perhaps give feedback about % complete as working through
- Mobile issues:
1) modals still too big for small screen
2) swiping has broken - jquery-mobile not referenced as a dependency
3) date picker isn't obvious when presented with keyboard input beneath text input
4) question summary list should just be one row, swipeable / pageable like outcomes list. Will require some complex logic to ensure the current question is as close to the centre of that display as possible
- test case - slow download of resources, anything available before it will actually work?
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers
- tip buttons near key functionality explaining what's going on
- use gallery-style slider for outcome previews and question summaries, must ensure current question always visible
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
- remove logos - will be provided by Wise & Hammer

Wise & Hammer meeting
- possibly ask user for name / location and have opt-in for newsletter at end of tool
	- change what's next screen to ask for email address and opt-in to newsletter

Considerations (for Chris):
- Using the tool could be emtionally raw for a user and this might need to be managed. Reactions might be different to the people that Matt deals with as they have already decided they are comfortable talking about it
- Reading level of tool & question text, would be best at grade 6 or 7
- how much time should be set aside and should they have someone with them?
- it's OK to not answer questions, though this will impact how helpful the tool can be
- Set expectations up front - base case and worse case
- trigger warning and suggestions for psychological support - users may have both legal and psychological concerns
