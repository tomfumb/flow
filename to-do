To Do:

HIGH
- not sure if there's a translation for 'N question(s) unanswered...'
- <<>> are actual characters :(
- issue with question buttons and right side padding overlapping q15 and left-most button sometimes disappearing a little on window resize
- Inconsistent capitalisation and quoting / >> in Why This Question
- Check last word of institution descriptions in case a non-split paragraph missed

MEDIUM
- several conditions where page should be scrolled to the top so that smaller screens don't lose context due to previous section's scroll
- possible to get firstVisibleIndex error, replicated by disabling and re-enabling large number of mechanisms after a full right-scroll. Checked 'company / corporation' to eliminate most
- update spreadsheet for any mechanism that had Disappearance added

LOW
- log info message on why a mechanism is eliminated
