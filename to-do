- Answers must be able to link to multiple outcomes
- carousel events for slide and slid need to control the availability of navigation buttons
- Need carousel content height to be something other than fixed pixel height
- It should already be possible to go back through answered questions and choose different answers. Should display which answer was already selected and provide forward option if downstream answers not wiped
- Should be showing available outcomes already too
