BUGS
- if changing answer to one that leads to an outcome something goes wrong
	- log shows onOutcomesReached but UI slides to a question
	- *** because although I slice the array and remove the following views I never remove the content from the DOM

- PrintView needs to handle answerChanged same as MainView
- Consider having contentView handle questions and outcomes in the same way - logic is getting ugly around whether or not to show the Back button
- Answers must be able to link to multiple outcomes
- carousel events for slide and slid need to control the availability of navigation buttons
- Need carousel content height to be something other than fixed pixel height
- It should already be possible to go back through answered questions and choose different answers. Should display which answer was already selected and provide forward option if downstream answers not wiped
- Should be showing available outcomes already too
- Use history api to make browser's back button work like previous question button
