- for multi-select questions with checkboxes - update answersSelected every time a box is checked and 'Continue' button is just another forward navigation button. 'Continue' should only be available if there is a following question
- when a question or outcome's visibility / availability is dependent on certain answer/s being selected the inspect function should also verify that those answers are available and log an error if not
- can it handle swipe actions? Back / fwd should permit this
- determine if OutcomePreviewView models keep up with available attribute and if so use in event handler
- Questions should show which answer was selected
- http://blog.jetstrap.com/2013/08/bootstrap-3-grids-explained/ - buttons will screw up at col-1, needs fixing for small screens
- If answering question with select list should transition after a slight delay during which the select list and navigation buttons are disabled
- what happens with large numbers of outcomes?
- carousel events for slide and slid need to control the availability of navigation buttons
- Need carousel content height to be something other than fixed pixel height
- Carousel navigation buttons should be in left / right floating DIVs and added by the ContentView - can't be controlled by QuestionView as this immediately slides out of view
- Use history api to make browser's back button work like previous question button

- if possible to move fwd and back through questions regardless of what's answered the UI should show which questions have been passed unanswered
