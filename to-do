- Answers must be able to link to multiple outcomes
- Bootstrap carousel only requires one carousel-inner element, not one per item
	- Carousel issue: get markup, duplicate to have two questions, hard-code in index.htm and see if same error occurs. If not, problem most likely due to only having one item.
	- If problems occur due to dynamically adding items then create 2 items up-front, cycle between them, and update their content whenever required. This approach not ideal but may be required 
	- Consider putting all carousel-related markup into a view's render function, keeping index.htm theme-free
- It should already be possible to go back through answered questions and choose different answers. Should display which answer was already selected and provide forward option if downstream answers not wiped
- Should be showing available outcomes already too
- Use history api to make browser's back button work like previous question button
