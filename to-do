To Do

HIGH
- remaining mechanisms (Canada criminal court still ongoing)
- Mobile issues:
1) modals still too big for small screen (check Android, iOS seems fine now)
2) date picker isn't obvious in Android when presented with keyboard input beneath text input
- check license and ownership
- Handover email
	- mailchimp integration
	- github
	- languages
	- my availability
	- contact info
	- explanation of mechanism conditions
	- server move considerations
	- restrictions?
	- deployment process (grunt tasks, testing, devices)

MEDIUM
- v-mouse integration?
- undo auto-focus on email address in next steps
- revert to 12 in bootstrap
- see if the carousel can be stopped mid-transition for a new transition as this will happen to the question summary row
- style outcome navigate buttons
- seem to be several conditions where phone needs scrolling to top of page
- ensure carousel speed and summary transition speed are in-sync, then standardise slide speed values using global

LOW
- only have useful log messages
- soften colours and make question text bigger - more engaging
- should have more consistency in index.htm IDs
- SEO (French?)
- test case - slow download of resources, anything available before it will actually work?
- test case - remove all outcome previews, what happens to slide / visible logic?
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers

VERY LOW
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
