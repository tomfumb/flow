- icon for question area (ESL)
- order mechanisms by international, regional, national
- update spreadsheet with used values
- if modal closed after showing options at end should be really obvious how to re-open it
- Mobile issues:
2) modal doesn't scroll when off screen
3) date picker isn't obvious when presented with keyboard input beneath text input
4) question summary list should just be one row, swipeable / pageable like outcomes list. Will require some complex logic to ensure the current question is as close to the centre of that display as possible
- when resizing container to fit summary height is not always correctly set - sometimes under or over shot. Possibly related to the briefly-displayed vertical scroll bar? Look for a pattern in this happening when the container gets larger or shorter relative to the previous slide
- some scenario where question summary links can be repeated and clicking the duplicates messes things up
- consider not automatically advancing the carousel if the user has explicitly requested a specific question, or if the following question is already answered - could get messy / confusing
- if the last question is conditionally available, is answered, and then becomes unavailable it is still treated as an available question (summary highlights as active and quesion is shown).
- Multiple consecutive conditional questions - if c is dependent on b and b dependent on a c should be unavailable when b is unavailable
- test case - what happens if a second answer is given during slide transition, does it slide twice?
- test case - slow download of resources, anything available before it will actually work?
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers
- tip buttons near key functionality explaining what's going on
- email results to user
- text wrap problem in single_few answers with long text when page narrow
- use gallery-style slider for outcome previews
- try to get rid of table in outcome previews
- main CCIJ site has Google Analytics - should incorporate the async version of this too, log trips to all #destinations
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
- consider creating sprite for images, especially logos with fixed size
- minify / compress js
