To Do

QUESTIONS
- which version of IE does Matt have?
- CRC has caveat about limitations period but then is eliminated if other remedies sought - shouldn't it permit if other remedies? 
	 - other mechanisms like this?

HIGH
- change text of kidnapping/disappearance to kidnapping, add kidnapping to any mechanisms that depend on disappearance (wgeid and 1 other?)
- add Stories links back in
- remaining mechanisms (*** Civil Canada in testing ***)
- cross-browser testing (IE, Firefox)
- swipe fails on Android Chrome
- why does selecting date make mechanisms unavailable?
- check license and ownership
- Completion email
	- testing, what to look for (one person per mechanism ?)
	- availability & committment, build a to-do list for me
	- french version
- Handover email
	- mailchimp integration
	- github
	- languages
	- my availability
	- contact info
	- explanation of mechanism conditions
	- server move considerations
	- restrictions?
	- deployment process (grunt tasks, testing, devices)

MEDIUM
- change q2a.hasAnswer('Yes') to q2b.isAvailable and remove q2a references
- justify home page text
- clickable yes/no on question 6 for child / woman that auto-checks the relevant checkbox
- additional space between mechanism description and caveat(s)
- shared question condition logic for very common scenarios, DRY
- figure out how to deploy with debug level change - necessary?
- double-clicking an answer triggers two question answered events - should disable question answering during answer/advance delay
- v-mouse integration?
- undo auto-focus on email address in next steps
- revert to 12 in bootstrap
- possible to get firstVisibleIndex error, replicated by disabling and re-enabling large number of mechanisms after a full right-scroll. Checked 'company / corporation' to eliminate most
- see if the carousel can be stopped mid-transition for a new transition as this will happen to the question summary row
- style outcome navigate buttons
- seem to be several conditions where phone needs scrolling to top of page
- ensure carousel speed and summary transition speed are in-sync, then standardise slide speed values using global
- update spreadsheet for any mechanism that had Disappearance added

LOW
- log info message on why a mechanism is eliminated
- only have useful log messages
- soften colours and make question text bigger - more engaging
- should have more consistency in index.htm IDs
- SEO (French?)
- test case - slow download of resources, anything available before it will actually work?
- test case - remove all outcome previews, what happens to slide / visible logic?
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers

VERY LOW
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
