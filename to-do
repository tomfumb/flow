To Do



Issues
	* currently ongoing *
		making titles of outcomes more obvious in preview images
			image is now too short as abbreviation doesn't live at the bottom (but could do?)
			preview areas can be bigger and should be a bit wider (check on 320px wide screen)
			centre images within container divs (after working on width)
			work seems to have broken swipe left / right on android (possible that swipe is set on the image and that's now covered?)



HIGH
- Technical handover email (awaiting completion of testing / refinements)
	- php configuration and server requirements
	- mailchimp integration
	- github
	- languages
	- my availability
	- contact info
	- explanation of mechanism conditions
	- server move considerations
	- deployment process (grunt tasks, testing, devices)

MEDIUM
- ** in progress ** shared question condition logic for very common scenarios, DRY
- several conditions where page should be scrolled to the top so that smaller screens don't lose context due to previous section's scroll
- v-mouse integration
- possible to get firstVisibleIndex error, replicated by disabling and re-enabling large number of mechanisms after a full right-scroll. Checked 'company / corporation' to eliminate most
- update spreadsheet for any mechanism that had Disappearance added

LOW
- log info message on why a mechanism is eliminated
- should have more consistency in index.htm IDs
- SEO

VERY LOW
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
