MEDIUM
- several conditions where page should be scrolled to the top so that smaller screens don't lose context due to previous section's scroll
- possible to get firstVisibleIndex error, replicated by disabling and re-enabling large number of mechanisms after a full right-scroll. Checked 'company / corporation' to eliminate most
- update spreadsheet for any mechanism that had Disappearance added

LOW
- log info message on why a mechanism is eliminated
