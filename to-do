- only have useful log messages
- position email and feedback buttons
- icon for question area (ESL)
- update spreadsheet with used values
- if modal closed after showing options at end should be really obvious how to re-open it
- replace modal for showing options with swipe left / right page - use modal only for emailing results and feedback
- Mobile issues:
2) modal doesn't scroll when off screen
3) date picker isn't obvious when presented with keyboard input beneath text input
4) question summary list should just be one row, swipeable / pageable like outcomes list. Will require some complex logic to ensure the current question is as close to the centre of that display as possible
- test case - slow download of resources, anything available before it will actually work?
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers
- tip buttons near key functionality explaining what's going on
- try and strip attributes from printed / posted html
- use gallery-style slider for outcome previews
- try to get rid of table in outcome previews
- main CCIJ site has Google Analytics - should incorporate the async version of this too, log trips to all #destinations
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
