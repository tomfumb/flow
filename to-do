To Do

HIGH
- Completion email
	- testing, what to look for (one person per mechanism ?)
	- availability & committment, build a to-do list for me
	- french version
- Handover email
	- mailchimp integration
	- github
	- languages
	- my availability

	- explanation of mechanism conditions
	- server move considerations
	- restrictions?
	- deployment process (grunt tasks, testing, devices)

MEDIUM
- seem to be several conditions where phone needs scrolling to top of page
- double-clicking an answer triggers two question answered events - should disable question answering during answer/advance delay
- ensure carousel speed and summary transition speed are in-sync, then standardise slide speed values using global
- see if the carousel can be stopped mid-transition for a new transition as this will happen to the question summary row
- additional space between mechanism description and caveat(s)
- shared question condition logic for very common scenarios, DRY
- revert to 12 in bootstrap
- v-mouse integration
- possible to get firstVisibleIndex error, replicated by disabling and re-enabling large number of mechanisms after a full right-scroll. Checked 'company / corporation' to eliminate most
- update spreadsheet for any mechanism that had Disappearance added

LOW
- log info message on why a mechanism is eliminated
- should have more consistency in index.htm IDs
- SEO

VERY LOW
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
