- update rules on mechanisms that have them

- calendar implementation needs finishing, must answer following questions (next line)
- how does calendar interact with 'has answer' functionality? new validation function required. Will the answer be selectable if it's not an option?
- when resizing container to fit summary height is not always correctly set - sometimes under or over shot. Possibly related to the briefly-displayed vertical scroll bar? Look for a pattern in this happening when the container gets larger or shorter relative to the previous slide
- observed one case where answeredQuestion in OutcomeManagerView became detached from collection? answeredQuestion.collection was undefined. need to understand how this is possible
- some scenario where question summary links can be repeated and clicking the duplicates messes things up
- for performance may be wise for mechanisms' conditions to use comma-separated question IDs as keys to distinct evaluations so that all questions involved in the availability of the condition are not evaluated each time an answer changes. Or something like that - anything that prevents the re-evaluation of everything could be good, but not a high priority concern right now
- consider not automatically advancing the carousel if the user has explicitly requested a specific question, or if the following question is already answered - could get messy / confusing
- if the last question is conditionally available, is answered, and then becomes unavailable it is still treated as an available question (summary highlights as active and quesion is shown).
- Multiple consecutive conditional questions - if c is dependent on b and b dependent on a c should be unavailable when b is unavailable
- test case - what happens if a second answer is given during slide transition, does it slide twice?
- set up routing with history API - handle page loading with hash location and question / area navigation history
- handle swipe actions for question back / fwd
- http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers
- tip buttons near key functionality explaining what's going on
- some sort of guide-through for new users (cookies?)
- separate remedies into available and unavailable
- consider stacking or hiding stacked for remedies
- print view
- emailing summary
- look for a way to reduce redundancy in outcome configuration - really can't just loop over the div.with_class and find a way to attach the condition?
- vertical overflow bar briefly showing in some carousel transitions
- check necessity of shims in index.htm
- consider creating sprite for images, especially logos with fixed size

Meeting 2014/01/28
- regardless of the device it needs to be really obvious to the user when the number of available options is updated, e.g. if count is not visible flash something in screen corner
- might need to have stories easily-accessible from the assess part so that users can refer back to stories for reference
- countries list needs to be agreed and not just forgotten about (current list is from US Dept. of State)
- feedback mechanism required, emails a CCIJ address
