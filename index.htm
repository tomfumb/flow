The Court of BiH has successfully dealt with the challenges that arose from specific circumstances of both the time and the environment in which it operates. It is against this background that the successful performance of the Court is to be regarded, including the successful prosecution of the cases referred to by the ICTY, the transition of the international Registry into the national institutions, which was completed in 2012, the active participation of the Court of BiH in the EU-BiH Structured Dialogue on Justice, and the implementation of the National War Crimes Prosecution Strategy.
